#### What is DAT? 

DAT is a nonprofit-backed community & open protocol for building apps of the future.

Use DAT command line to share files with version control, back up data to servers, browse remote files on demand, and automate long-term data preservatio

See [datproject.org](https://datproject.org), [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) for dat specific details.

#### What is DAT?

Share, backup, and publish your filesystem. You can turn any folder on your computer into a dat. DAT scans your folder, allowing you to:

* Track your files with automatic version history.
* Share files with others over a secure peer to peer network.
* Automate live backups to external HDs or remote servers.
* Publish and share files with built in HTTP server.

DAT allows you to focus on the fun work without worrying about moving files around. **Secure**, **distributed**, **fast**.

Rather not use the command line? Check out these options:

* [DAT Desktop] - A desktop app to manage multiple dats on your desktop machine.
* [Beaker Browser] - An experimental p2p browser with built-in support for the DAT protocol.
